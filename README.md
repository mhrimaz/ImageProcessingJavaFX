Simple image filtering with Matrix Convolution Filtering

Convolution is an important operation in signal and image processing.
Convolution operates on two signals (in 1D) or two images (in 2D):
you can think of one as the “input” signal (or image),
and the other (called the kernel) as a “filter” on the input image,
producing an output image (so convolution takes two images as input and produces a third as output).
Convolution is an incredibly important concept in many areas of math and engineering (including computer vision, as we’ll see later).
